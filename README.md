# RepeatAnalyzer

This is a new home for the RepeatAnalyzer project found at: https://bitbucket.org/repeatgroup/repeatanalyzer/src/master/ 

## Notes

The most up to date version of RepeatAnalyzer.dat that I have been using in testing is also there.
It currently only has data for A. marginale and is not complete. 
Additionally, some locations are stored incorrectly. For instance, in South Africa, "freestate" will not 
return any results because the data is stored to "northeastern freestate". There are analogous problems
for several areas.
The MapData folder holds shapefiles of the borders used in mapping, collected from naturalearthdata.com
For areas with more than 15 or so repeats on a single point, pie charts will become blurred.
Legends may also run off the map if they contain over 20 or so entries.
